# Enterprise_Business_Plan - Skyvion Bikes

## Problem Statement:
The cycling industry is in need of a new, innovative product that can cater to the needs of young single workers, young families, and students. Current electric bikes on the market are not meeting the needs of these customers, and there is a gap in the market for a self-balancing road bike that is safe, efficient, and affordable.

## Key Deliverables:
Skyvion aims to fill this gap in the market by offering a self-balancing road bike that is equipped with advanced AI technology to ensure balance and safety. Our bikes are designed with the needs of our primary customer base in mind, and we offer two sub-segments: Road Commuting and Road Fitness. Our bikes are affordable, efficient, and easy to use, making them the perfect choice for anyone looking for a reliable and safe mode of transportation.
